/**
 * The IRQ server helps to manage the IRQs in a system. There are 3 API levels
 * in the design
 *   1. [irq server node]   The IRQ server node is a set of IRQs and their
 *                          associated handlers. It is a passive system, hence,
 *                          the application is responsible for waiting on the
 *                          appropriate notification endpoint for events.
 *                          The AEP binding feature of the seL4 kernel may be used
 *                          here to listen to both synchronous IPC and IRQ
 *                          notification events.
 *   2. [irq server thread] An IRQ server node is a standalone thread which waits
 *                          for the arrival of any IRQ that is being managed by a
 *                          particular irq server node. When an IRQ is received,
 *                          the irq server thread will either forward the irq
 *                          information to a registered synchronous endpoint, or
 *                          call the appropriate handler function directly.
 *   3. [irq server]        A dynamic collection of server threads. When
 *                          registering an IRQ call back function, the irq server
 *                          will attempt to deligate the IRQ to an irq server node
 *                          that has not yet reached capacity. If no node can accept
 *                          the IRQ, a new irq server thread will be created to
 *                          support the additional demand.
 *
 * ++ Special notes ++
 *
 * Performance
 *   The application can achieve greater performance by configuring the irq server,
 *   or irq server threads, to call the IRQ handler functions directly. In this
 *   case, the application must take care to ensure that all concurrency issues are
 *   addressed.
 *
 * Resource availability
 *   The irq server API family accept resource allocators as arguments to some
 *   function calls. In a dynamic system design, these resource allocators
 *   must be kept available indefinitely, or until the system reaches a known
 *   steady state.
